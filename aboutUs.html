    <h1> About Us</h1>
    <p>This business originated as a small child fantasy and my fond interests of fish, specifically Salmon. Out of all of the types of Salmon that I liked, <br> 
    Chinook has to be my favourite and the main design of the cookies I sell. Wondering what impact I could make as an ichthyologist, I knew 
    <br>
    I could make the biggest impact of raising awareness of the decline in fish population, the marine life, and ecosystem by selling cookies. 
    <br>They are both delicious in taste and cute in shape. 
    With every purchase, all of the proceeds are for helping save marine wild life. Feel free 
    <br> to pick up a salmon t shirt and show off your love for salmons and cookies!
